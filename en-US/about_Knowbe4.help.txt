SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Simplifies PowerShell access to the KMSAT reporting API as well as to user management via the Selenium web driver.

LONG DESCRIPTION

EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE 1: Connecting for the first time
    # Stores your API token in AppData. Possible Location values are Temp, AppData, UserRoot
    Save-Kb4Token -Token "$TOKEN" -HostURI "https://us.api.knowbe4.com" -Location AppData

    # Connects to the KB4 api with the token we stored with Save-Kb4Token
    Connect-Kb4 -TokenLocation AppData

    # Start the web driver. This does NOT require calls to Save-Kb4Token and Connect-Kb4. But it does require Selenium and Chrome to be installed.
    # The call to Start-Kb4Driver will open up the login page on the browser. You'll need to log-in manually.

    
    $Driver = Start-Kb4Driver
    if ($NULL -eq $Driver)
    {
        throw "Failed to login to Knowbe4"
    }

EXAMPLE 2: Creating a new user
    $Driver = Start-Kb4Driver
    New-Kb4User -Driver $Driver -Email "Zach_Alexander@TurdNuggets.com" -FirstName "Zach" -LastName "Alexander" `
        -ManagerName "Biggus Dickus" -ManagerEmail "Biggus_Dickus@TurdNuggets.com" -Department "Customer Relations" `
        -EmployeeStartDate (Get-Date -Year 1993 -Month 5 -Day 16)

EXAMPLE 3: Migrating AzureAD environment to Knowbe4 without AAD Sync
    # Import the Knowbe4 module
    Import-Modulue Knowbe4.psm1

    # Connect to the RestAPI using a token stored in AppData
    Connect-Kb4 -TokenLocation AppData

    # Start the web driver
    $Driver = Start-Kb4Driver

    # Import AzureAD (AzureAD doesn't have a PowerShell 7 version.)
    Import-Module AzureAD -UseWindowsPowerShell

    # Connect to MSOnline
    Connect-AzureAD

    # Get a list of all users currently in KB4
    $Kb4Users = Get-KB4Users

    # Get all licensed AzureAD mailboxes that aren't in KB4 yet and create accounts for them.
    Get-AzureADUser -All:$True | Where-Object {$_.AssignedLicenses -and $_.UserPrincipalName -notin $Kb4Users.email} | Foreach-Object {

        # Get the manager object
        $Manager = $_ | Get-AzureADUserManager

        # Create a user in Knowbe4
        New-Kb4User -Driver $Driver -Email $_.UserPrincipalName -FirstName $_.GivenName -LastName $_.SurName `
            -Department $_.Department -ManagerName $Manager.DisplayName -ManagerEmail $Manager.UserPrincipalName # etc.
    }
